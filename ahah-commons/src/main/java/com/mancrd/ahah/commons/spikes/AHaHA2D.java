 * An AHaHA2D instance is used to convert real-valued signals into a spike code. It is a decision tree nodes operating anti-hebbian plasticity. A AHaHA2D takes values in the update

 * of the decision tree to the leaves. The update method returns a binary number encoded as an integer giving routing path up the tree. A call to "putAndParse" will convert this path to a spike code
 * consisting of the distinct nodes alone the route.
